Understanding grid emissions across the country has been significant in the decarbonization movement. It’s especially relevant within facilities that are trying to reduce power consumption with corresponding carbon emissions. Since Atlas is providing them a method of power reduction, there should also exist a method of displaying emission reduction. Since we are not relying on a way to directly measure CO2 emissions, we can define a reduction in terms of site’s energy consumption and CO2 intensity data available through Singularity.   

Singularities Carbonara API provides all necessary data on fuel consumption rates/trends, carbon intensity rates/trends and the influx/outflux of energy across a region and within their power plants.
